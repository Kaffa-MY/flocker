========================
Get Started with Flocker
========================

Before you begin to install Flocker, there are a couple of ways in which you can try out Flocker without having to go through the full installation steps:

Flocker in a Live Hosted Environment
------------------------------------

You can take Flocker for a spin using a free, live hosted environment. 
No installation is required, and it’s great for getting a hands-on introduction to what Flocker is all about.

* The live demo environment is hosted by ClusterHQ.
* The demo environment will include a fully-installed and configured 2-node Flocker cluster and CLI.
* You will have root access to this environment, so you can test Flocker however you want.
* Follow a step-by-step tutorial.
* To give you time to play, you’ll have access to the environment for 3 hours.

For more information, see the `Try Flocker`_ page.

Flocker Installed Locally Using Vagrant
---------------------------------------

For quick experiments, you can set up a cluster locally on virtual machines using our Vagrant image.

Our MongoDB tutorial uses both VirtualBox and Vagrant to install Flocker and Docker, and walks you through an end-to-end example of using Flocker to create an application.

For more information, see the :ref:`MongoDB tutorial <tutorial-mongo>` and :ref:`vagrant-setup`.
