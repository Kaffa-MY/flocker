Quick Start Flocker Installer
=============================

.. note:: For a full Flocker installation, including :ref:`docker-plugin`, see the :ref:`full-installation` instructions.

If you want to get started with Flocker quickly, but in your own environment, you can use the Quick Start Flocker Installer.
The Installer is one of our :ref:`Labs projects <labs-projects>`, so is currently experimental.

* The Installer runs locally in a Docker container on your machine.
* It provisions nodes on AWS, and then installs Flocker, Docker, and the Flocker plugin for Docker.
* You can reconfigure the cluster at any time.
* The :ref:`Labs Installer <labs-installer>` documentation includes several tutorials to make it easy to set up and manage a Flocker cluster.

For more information, see the :ref:`Labs Installer <labs-installer>` page.
